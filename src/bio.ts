I have a bachelor’s degree in business administration and Management and a certificate of digital marketing of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. I also owed a certificate in Photoshop and Lightroom programs of adobe.
    I was born and raised in Volos, a beautiful city in Greece. Always i am inclined to art , sports and nature. I love walking and exploring new places. My passion is travelling and this empowered me to deal with photography.
    Photography came to my life as a hobby in 2017. I use this art as a way of expressing myself and bringing out the best in my subjects. I am always looking forward for new and creative ways to bring uniqueness into my photography.
    I ll be very happy to work together . Feel free to contact me.`
